## About the project 
ChefPal is a gamified learning app targeted towards university students and young adults who struggle to cook. As cooking is a critical skill to understanding cultures and learning life skills like healthy eating, budgeting and cleaning, ChefPal makes the process of learning recipes, kitchen safety and nutrition easy and fun through the use of gamification mechanics.

## How to run the app
1. Clone the repositry 
2. Run the app!

## Considerations
* As we are using a free version of the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs), there is a daily quota limit on how many times the API can be called. Therefore, if you are re-running the app many times, the API might stop returning data (however, we have rarely have come across this issue)
* When singing up, please make sure the password is at least 6 characters (Firebase requirement)
